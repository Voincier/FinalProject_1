# FinalProject_1

## How to Use

1. Open Visual Studio 2019
2. Open Project using .csproj or .sln file (FinalProject1.csproj / FinalProject1.sln)
3. Run the Project using IIS Express
4. Try CRUD using swagger with POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE
5. If the page is closed, the project will be closed automatically.

## How it works

1. POST will create a new Payment Details that will be saved in 'app.db'
2. GET will show a selected/all Payment Details data from 'app.db'
3. PUT will update an existing Payment Details data based on the 'paymentDetailsId'
4. DELETE will delete the Payment Details data from 'app.db' based on 'paymentDetailsId'
